"Data Intense" means data throughput rather over compute.

The book talks about what it indends to cover being understanding the core components and trade offs of various technology components used in system design. The book intends to cover various composition of these components.

Components:
- databases
- search indexes
- caches
- message queues

Starting in chapter 1 there are 3 poignant attributes of data intense applications pointed out. 
- Reliability
  - Systems should be fault tolerant to hardware failures and human failures.
Scalability
  - Systems should be able to be easiliy scaled to handle increased loads.
Maintainability
  - Systems should be able to be worked on productively by various and changing individuals. They should be able to be easily diagnosed, understood and observed.
